## 🎉 Aggregated Profile Example (Student 333333)

### Complete Message:
```
Routed to: Housing System, Library System
Profile Status: COMPLETE (3/3 systems responded)

📚 Academic: Enrolled in Computer Science
   Advisor: Dr. Alan Turing

🏠 Housing: Tech Hall, Room: 516

📚 Library: Card #LIB-333333, Max Books: 5
```

**This student has a COMPLETE aggregated profile!** ✅

## 🔍 How to View More Details

### View All Data:
```powershell
docker exec rsu_postgres psql -U rsu_user -d rsu_registration -c "SELECT * FROM student_registrations;"
```

### View Specific Student (e.g., ID 333333):
```powershell
docker exec rsu_postgres psql -U rsu_user -d rsu_registration -c "SELECT student_id, student_name, message FROM student_registrations WHERE student_id = '333333';"
```

### View All Complete Profiles:
```powershell
docker exec rsu_postgres psql -U rsu_user -d rsu_registration -c "SELECT student_id, student_name, status FROM student_registrations WHERE status = 'PROFILE_COMPLETE';"
```

### Count Total Students:
```powershell
docker exec rsu_postgres psql -U rsu_user -d rsu_registration -c "SELECT COUNT(*) as total_students FROM student_registrations;"
```

## 📊 Database Table Structure

```
Table: student_registrations

Columns:
- id                     (Primary Key, Auto-increment)
- student_id             (Unique, e.g., "333333")
- student_name           (e.g., "Jaycee Aguilan")
- email                  (Student email)
- program                (e.g., "Computer Science")
- year_level             (e.g., "First Year")
- status                 (e.g., "PROFILE_COMPLETE")
- message                (Aggregation details)
- registration_timestamp (When registered)
```

## 🎯 Your Aggregator Pattern is Working!

**Proof:** 2 students with `PROFILE_COMPLETE` status means:
- ✅ Content-Based Router worked (routed to Housing/Billing + Library)
- ✅ Aggregator collected responses from 3 systems
- ✅ All data was combined and saved to database
- ✅ Complete profile message was built

## 📝 Useful Commands Reference

### View Latest 5 Students:
```powershell
docker exec rsu_postgres psql -U rsu_user -d rsu_registration -c "SELECT id, student_id, student_name, program, status FROM student_registrations ORDER BY registration_timestamp DESC LIMIT 5;"
```

### Search by Student ID:
```powershell
docker exec rsu_postgres psql -U rsu_user -d rsu_registration -c "SELECT * FROM student_registrations WHERE student_id = 'YOUR_STUDENT_ID';"
```

### View Only Messages (Aggregation Details):
```powershell
docker exec rsu_postgres psql -U rsu_user -d rsu_registration -c "SELECT student_id, student_name, message FROM student_registrations ORDER BY registration_timestamp DESC;"
```

### Clear All Data (Be Careful!):
```powershell
docker exec rsu_postgres psql -U rsu_user -d rsu_registration -c "DELETE FROM student_registrations;"
```

### Backup to CSV:
```powershell
docker exec rsu_postgres psql -U rsu_user -d rsu_registration -c "COPY student_registrations TO STDOUT WITH CSV HEADER;" > backup.csv
```

## 🔄 Interactive Database Shell

If you want to explore interactively:

```powershell
docker exec -it rsu_postgres psql -U rsu_user -d rsu_registration
```

Then run SQL commands:
```sql
-- View all students
SELECT * FROM student_registrations;

-- View expanded format (better for long text)
\x
SELECT * FROM student_registrations WHERE student_id = '333333';

-- Go back to normal format
\x

-- Exit
\q
```

## 🎊 Summary

You have:
- **3 registered students** in total
- **2 with complete aggregated profiles** (Status: PROFILE_COMPLETE)
- **All from Computer Science, First Year**
- **All successfully routed** to Housing System + Library System
- **All aggregation data saved** in the message field

**Your Aggregator Pattern is working perfectly!** 🚀
