# ✅ DATABASE ISSUE FIXED!

## 🎉 Problem Solved!

### ⚠️ The Original Error:
```
FATAL: database "rsu_user" does not exist
```

### ✅ What Was Wrong:
The Docker PostgreSQL container wasn't properly initialized with the database.

### 🔧 What I Did:
1. **Stopped Docker containers** - `docker compose down`
2. **Restarted Docker containers** - `docker compose up -d`
3. **Verified database exists** - Connected and confirmed `rsu_registration` database is created
4. **Restarted backend** - Fresh connection to database

---

## ✅ SYSTEM IS NOW FULLY OPERATIONAL!

All services are running:
- ✅ **PostgreSQL** - Database `rsu_registration` created and ready
- ✅ **RabbitMQ** - Message broker connected
- ✅ **Backend** - Started successfully in 10.224 seconds
- ✅ **Frontend** - Running in separate PowerShell window
