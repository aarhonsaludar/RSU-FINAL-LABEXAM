# ✅ ALL SYSTEMS GO - NO ERRORS!

## 🎉 Docker Error FIXED + System READY!

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed:

### The Error:
```
FATAL: database "rsu_user" does not exist
```

### The Solution:
Updated Docker healthcheck in `docker-compose.yml` to specify the correct database:
```yaml
pg_isready -U rsu_user -d rsu_registration
```

### The Result:
```
✅ rsu_postgres   (healthy) - No more errors!
✅ rsu_rabbitmq   (healthy) - Working perfectly!
```
