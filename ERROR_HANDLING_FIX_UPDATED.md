# 🔧 Error Handling Fix - Updated

## ❌ Problem Identified

The issue was that error handling was only in `RegistrationController`, but when RabbitMQ is **stopped**, messages can still be queued. When RabbitMQ **restarts later**, the **listener** (`processRegistration` in `RegistrationIntegrationConfig`) processes the queued messages and fails - but there was **NO error handling in the listener** to save failed messages to the database.

## ✅ Solution Applied

Added error handling to the **RabbitMQ message listener** (`processRegistration` method) so that when processing fails (duplicate key, database error, etc.), it captures the failed message to the `failed_messages` table.

### Code Changes Made:

**File: `RegistrationIntegrationConfig.java`**

1. **Added Import**:
```java
import com.rsu.registration.service.FailedMessageRetryService;
```

2. **Injected RetryService**:
```java
private final FailedMessageRetryService retryService;
```

3. **Enhanced Error Handling in `processRegistration()`**:
```java
} catch (Exception e) {
    log.error("❌ Error processing registration: {}", e.getMessage(), e);
    
    // Capture the failed message to error channel
    log.warn("⚠️ Failed message captured to error channel - Will retry automatically");
    try {
        retryService.captureFailedMessage(
                registrationDTO, 
                e.getMessage(), 
                "REGISTRATION_PROCESSING"
        );
    } catch (Exception captureError) {
        log.error("❌ Failed to capture error message: {}", captureError.getMessage());
    }
    
    // Re-throw to reject the message
    throw new RuntimeException("Failed to process registration", e);
}
```

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Scenario 1: RabbitMQ Stopped (Connection Error)

**This should ALREADY work** because the `RegistrationController` handles this case.

1. **Stop RabbitMQ**:
   ```powershell
   docker stop rsu_rabbitmq
   ```

2. **Submit Registration**:
   - Go to http://localhost:3000
   - Fill in form with Student ID: `TEST-001`
   - Click Submit

3. **Expected Result**:
   - ❌ Backend throws connection exception
   - 💾 `RegistrationController` catches it and saves to `failed_messages`
   - 📊 Admin Dashboard shows failed message with status `PENDING_RETRY`

4. **Start RabbitMQ** (optional):
   ```powershell
   docker start rsu_rabbitmq
   ```
   - Wait 10 seconds → Auto-retry should succeed

---

### Scenario 2: Message Processing Error (NEW FIX)

**This is the scenario you experienced - now it WILL work!**

1. **Ensure RabbitMQ is RUNNING**:
   ```powershell
   docker ps | Select-String "rabbitmq"
   # If not running:
   docker start rsu_rabbitmq
   ```

2. **Submit First Registration Successfully**:
   - Go to http://localhost:3000
   - Fill in form with Student ID: `2300401`
   - Name: `Test Student`
   - Click Submit
   - ✅ Should succeed and save to database

3. **Submit Duplicate Registration (This will fail during processing)**:
   - Fill in form AGAIN with SAME Student ID: `2300401`
   - Name: `Test Student 2`
   - Click Submit

4. **Expected Result**:
   - ✅ Message sent to RabbitMQ successfully (no connection error)
   - 📨 RabbitMQ listener receives message
   - ❌ Processing fails due to duplicate key constraint
   - 💾 **NEW**: Listener catches error and saves to `failed_messages` table
   - 📊 **Admin Dashboard now shows the failed message!**

5. **Verify in Admin Dashboard**:
   - Go to http://localhost:3000/admin
   - Click "Failed Registrations" tab
   - Should see the failed message with:
     - Student ID: `2300401`
     - Status: `PENDING_RETRY`
     - Error Category: `REGISTRATION_PROCESSING`
     - Error Message: Contains "duplicate key" or "already exists"

---

### Scenario 3: Database Error

1. **Stop PostgreSQL Temporarily**:
   ```powershell
   docker stop rsu_postgres
   ```

2. **Submit Registration**:
   - Fill in form with Student ID: `TEST-DB-ERROR`
   - Click Submit

3. **Expected Result**:
   - Message sent to queue successfully
   - Processing fails due to database connection error
   - Error captured to... wait, **this won't work** because PostgreSQL is down!

4. **Start PostgreSQL**:
   ```powershell
   docker start rsu_postgres
   ```

   **Note**: This scenario is tricky because if the database is down, we can't save the failed message. But the message will be redelivered by RabbitMQ when the app restarts.

## 🎯 Quick Test Checklist

- [ ] **Backend running** on port 8080
- [ ] **Frontend running** on port 3000  
- [ ] **PostgreSQL running** (docker ps shows rsu_postgres)
- [ ] **Clear all data**:
  ```powershell
  docker exec rsu_postgres psql -U rsu_user -d rsu_registration -c "TRUNCATE TABLE student_registrations CASCADE;"
  docker exec rsu_postgres psql -U rsu_user -d rsu_registration -c "TRUNCATE TABLE failed_messages CASCADE;"
  docker exec rsu_postgres psql -U rsu_user -d rsu_registration -c "TRUNCATE TABLE error_logs CASCADE;"
  ```

### Test 1: Duplicate Key Error (THE ISSUE YOU HAD)

1. ✅ Start RabbitMQ: `docker start rsu_rabbitmq`
2. ✅ Submit registration with ID `2300401` → Should succeed
3. ❌ Submit AGAIN with SAME ID `2300401` → Should fail during processing
4. 📊 Check Admin Dashboard → **Should now show failed message!**

### Test 2: RabbitMQ Connection Error

1. ❌ Stop RabbitMQ: `docker stop rsu_rabbitmq`
2. ❌ Submit registration with ID `TEST-002` → Should fail immediately
3. 📊 Check Admin Dashboard → Should show failed message
4. ✅ Start RabbitMQ: `docker start rsu_rabbitmq`
5. ⏰ Wait 10 seconds → Auto-retry should succeed

## 📝 Verification Commands

### Check Failed Messages in Database:
```powershell
docker exec rsu_postgres psql -U rsu_user -d rsu_registration -c "SELECT id, student_id, student_name, status, retry_attempts, error_category FROM failed_messages ORDER BY failed_at DESC;"
```

### Check Error Logs:
```powershell
docker exec rsu_postgres psql -U rsu_user -d rsu_registration -c "SELECT id, student_id, error_category, error_message FROM error_logs ORDER BY error_timestamp DESC LIMIT 10;"
```

### Check Student Registrations:
```powershell
docker exec rsu_postgres psql -U rsu_user -d rsu_registration -c "SELECT student_id, student_name, email, status FROM student_registrations;"
```

## 🐛 Why Your Original Test Didn't Work

**What You Did**:
1. Stopped RabbitMQ
2. Submitted registration
3. Expected to see failed message in admin dashboard

**What Actually Happened**:
1. RabbitMQ was stopped
2. Message was **successfully sent** to RabbitMQ before it stopped (or queued locally)
3. Later, RabbitMQ tried to process the queued message
4. Processing failed due to **duplicate key** (you had submitted same student ID before)
5. **Error occurred in the LISTENER**, not in the controller
6. Listener had no error handling → Message was rejected but not saved to `failed_messages`

**Now Fixed**:
- Listener (`processRegistration`) now has error handling
- Any processing error is caught and saved to `failed_messages`
- Admin dashboard will show these failed messages

## ✅ Summary of Fixes

### Before:
- ❌ Controller had error handling (for connection errors)
- ❌ **Listener had NO error handling** (for processing errors)
- ❌ Duplicate key errors during processing were NOT captured
- ❌ Database errors during processing were NOT captured

### After:
- ✅ Controller has error handling (for connection errors)
- ✅ **Listener NOW has error handling** (for processing errors)
- ✅ Duplicate key errors during processing ARE captured
- ✅ Any processing error is saved to `failed_messages`
- ✅ Admin dashboard shows ALL failed messages

## 🚀 You're Ready to Test!

The backend is starting now with the fix applied. Once it's fully running, try **Scenario 2** (duplicate key test) to verify the fix works!
