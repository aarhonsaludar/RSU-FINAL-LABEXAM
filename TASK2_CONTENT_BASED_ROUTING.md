## 🔧 Components Created

### 1. **ContentBasedRouterService.java**
- Main routing logic
- Examines `yearLevel` field
- Routes to appropriate systems
- Returns routing results

```java
public RoutingResult routeRegistration(StudentRegistrationDTO registration) {
    // Determine if first year
    boolean isFirstYear = isFirstYearStudent(registration.getYearLevel());
    
    if (isFirstYear) {
        // Route to Housing System
        housingService.allocateHousing(registration);
    } else {
        // Route to Billing System
        billingService.processBilling(registration);
    }
    
    // All students go to Library
    libraryService.activateLibraryAccount(registration);
}
```

### 2. **HousingService.java**
- Processes first-year students
- Allocates dormitory buildings
- Assigns room types
- Uses program-based logic for building assignment

**Logic:**
- Engineering/Computer Science → Tech Hall
- Business/Management → Commerce Building
- Arts/Humanities → Liberal Arts Residence
- Others → Main Campus Dormitory

### 3. **BillingService.java**
- Processes returning students (2nd-4th year)
- Calculates tuition fees
- Adds miscellaneous fees
- Applies year-level multipliers

**Fee Structure:**
- 2nd Year: Base fee × 1.05
- 3rd Year: Base fee × 1.10
- 4th Year: Base fee × 1.15

### 4. **LibraryService.java**
- Processes ALL students
- Generates library card numbers
- Sets account expiration (1 year)
- Configures loan limits (5 books)

### 5. **RoutingDecisionDTO.java**
- Data structure for routing information
- Contains student details
- Lists systems routed to
- Includes processing status for each system

## 🔀 Routing Rules

### First Year Students (`yearLevel = "1"` or `"First Year"`)
```
✅ Housing System     → Dormitory allocation
✅ Library System     → Account activation
❌ Billing System     → Skipped (handled during orientation)
```

### Returning Students (`yearLevel = "2", "3", "4"` or `"Second/Third/Fourth Year"`)
```
❌ Housing System     → Skipped (already assigned)
✅ Billing System     → Fee calculation
✅ Library System     → Account renewal
```

---

## 🎨 Frontend Implementation

### Real-Time Routing Display

When a student submits registration, they immediately see:

1. **Routing Decision Badge**
   - 🎓 First Year Student (purple badge)
   - 📖 Returning Student (pink badge)

2. **Routing Message**
   - Clear explanation of routing decision
   - Which systems will process the registration

3. **Systems List**
   - 🏠 Housing System (for first-year)
   - 💰 Billing System (for returning)
   - 📚 Library System (for all)

4. **Educational Info Box**
   - Explains Content-Based Routing pattern
   - Shows routing rules
   - Displays tech stack

2. Fill form:
   - Name: "Test Student 1"
   - ID: "2024-00001"
   - Email: "test1@rsu.edu"
   - Program: "Computer Science"
   - **Year Level: "First Year"** ← Important!
3. Click "Submit Registration"
4. **Verify:**
   - ✅ Success message appears
   - ✅ Badge shows "🎓 First Year Student"
   - ✅ Systems list shows "Housing System" and "Library System"
   - ✅ Routing message mentions Housing

### Step 3: Test Returning Student
1. Fill form:
   - Name: "Test Student 2"
   - ID: "2023-00002"
   - Email: "test2@rsu.edu"
   - Program: "Business Administration"
   - **Year Level: "Second Year"** ← Important!
2. Click "Submit Registration"
3. **Verify:**
   - ✅ Success message appears
   - ✅ Badge shows "📖 Returning Student"
   - ✅ Systems list shows "Billing System" and "Library System"
   - ✅ Routing message mentions Billing

### Step 4: Check Backend Logs
Look at the PowerShell window with the backend:
- Should see emoji icons (🔀, 🏠, 💰, 📚)
- Should see routing decisions
- Should see system processing messages

## ✅ Checkpoint Verification

### ✅ First-year students correctly routed to Housing system
**Test:** Submit with "First Year" → Check logs for "🏠 HOUSING SYSTEM"

### ✅ Returning students correctly routed to Billing system
**Test:** Submit with "Second Year", "Third Year", or "Fourth Year" → Check logs for "💰 BILLING SYSTEM"

### ✅ All students receive Library Services messages
**Test:** Submit ANY year level → Check logs for "📚 LIBRARY SYSTEM"

### ✅ Various combinations tested
- ✅ First Year + Computer Science
- ✅ Second Year + Business
- ✅ Third Year + Nursing
- ✅ Fourth Year + Engineering
