```

**Notice the difference:**
- First Year gets **Housing Assignment** 🏠
- Returning Students get **Billing Information** 💰

---

## 🎯 What to Observe

### 1. **Routing Messages (Task 2)**
After clicking "Register Student", you'll immediately see:
```
✅ Student registered successfully!
🔀 Routing to: Housing System, Library System
```

### 2. **Loading Spinner (3-second delay)**
A spinner appears with text: "Loading aggregated profile..."

### 3. **Aggregated Profile Display**
After 3 seconds, the complete profile appears showing:
- ✅ **Status Badge**: Green "COMPLETE" badge
- ⚡ **Response Time**: How fast the aggregation completed (800-2500ms typically)
- 📊 **Response Count**: "3/3 Systems Responded"
- 📚 **Academic Section**: Enrollment, GPA, Advisor
- 🏠/💰 **Housing or Billing**: Depends on year level
- 📚 **Library Section**: Card number, max books

### 4. **Variable Aggregation Times**
Each registration will have a **different aggregation time** because:
- Academic Records: 500-2000ms (random)
- Housing/Billing: 600-2500ms (random)
- Library: 400-1800ms (random)

**Try registering multiple students and watch the times change!**

## 🔍 Backend Logs to Watch

Open the PowerShell window where backend is running. You should see:

```
📨 Processing registration for student: 2024-AGG001
🔀 Applying Content-Based Routing for year level: First Year
🔀 ROUTER: Routing John Aggregator to HOUSING SYSTEM (First Year Student)
🔀 ROUTER: Routing John Aggregator to LIBRARY SYSTEM (All Students)

🔄 AGGREGATOR: Starting aggregation for student: John Aggregator
🔄 AGGREGATOR: Initiating Academic, Housing, Library system calls
📚 ACADEMIC RECORDS SYSTEM: Processing enrollment (took 1234ms)
🏠 HOUSING SYSTEM: Processing housing assignment (took 1567ms)
📚 LIBRARY SYSTEM: Processing library account (took 892ms)
✅ AGGREGATOR: Successfully aggregated profile in 1623ms
📊 AGGREGATOR: Responses - Academic: ✓, Housing/Billing: ✓, Library: ✓

💾 Saving registration to database with complete profile
✅ Successfully processed registration with ID: 1
```

## 🧪 Advanced Tests

### Test 3: Multiple Submissions (Observe Different Times)

Register 5 different students and compare aggregation times:

| Student | Year Level | Aggregation Time | Systems |
|---------|-----------|------------------|---------|
| Student 1 | First Year | ~1200ms | Academic + Housing + Library |
| Student 2 | Second Year | ~1800ms | Academic + Billing + Library |
| Student 3 | Third Year | ~1500ms | Academic + Billing + Library |
| Student 4 | Fourth Year | ~2100ms | Academic + Billing + Library |
| Student 5 | First Year | ~1400ms | Academic + Housing + Library |

**Each will have different times due to random response delays!**

---

### Test 4: Different Programs (Observe Different Advisors/Buildings)

Try these program combinations:

| Program | Advisor Assigned | Building (1st Year) |
|---------|------------------|---------------------|
| Computer Science | Dr. Alan Turing | Tech Hall |
| Business Administration | Prof. Peter Drucker | Commerce Building |
| Engineering | Dr. Nikola Tesla | Tech Hall |
| Nursing | Dr. Florence Nightingale | Main Campus Dormitory |
| Education | Prof. John Dewey | Liberal Arts Residence |
| Liberal Arts | Dr. Martha Nussbaum | Liberal Arts Residence |

## 🎨 UI Features to Notice

### Status Badges
- 🟢 **Green "COMPLETE"**: All 3 systems responded successfully
- 🟡 **Yellow "PARTIAL"**: Only some systems responded (timeout scenario)
- 🔴 **Red "TIMEOUT"**: Aggregation exceeded 30 seconds

### Profile Sections
- Each section has a distinct icon (📚, 🏠, 💰)
- Color-coded headers for easy reading
- Grid layout for clean organization

### Loading State
- Animated spinner during aggregation
- "Loading aggregated profile..." message
- Disappears when profile is ready

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

Your Aggregator Pattern is working correctly if you see:

1. ✅ **All 3 system responses** displayed in profile
2. ✅ **Status shows "COMPLETE"** with green badge
3. ✅ **Response count is "3/3"**
4. ✅ **Aggregation time** is under 3000ms (usually 800-2500ms)
5. ✅ **Different data** for each student (random advisors, rooms, etc.)
6. ✅ **Backend logs** show all systems processing
7. ✅ **First year** gets Housing, **Returning** gets Billing

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem: Profile doesn't appear after 3 seconds

**Solution:** Check browser console (F12) for errors. Make sure:
- Backend is running on port 8080
- No CORS errors in console
- Student was successfully registered (check routing messages appear first)

### Problem: Status shows "PARTIAL" or "TIMEOUT"

**Solution:** This is actually expected behavior for timeout testing! But if it happens every time:
- Check backend logs for errors
- Ensure PostgreSQL database is running
- Restart backend if needed

### Problem: Backend logs show errors

**Solution:**
```powershell
# Restart backend
cd c:\Users\Jaycee\Desktop\RSU-FINAL-LABEXAM
.\restart-backend.ps1
```

## 🎊 You're Testing the Aggregator Pattern!

**What makes this Enterprise Integration Pattern special:**

1. ⚡ **Parallel Processing**: All 3 systems called simultaneously (faster than sequential)
2. ⏱️ **Timeout Protection**: 30-second safety net prevents infinite waits
3. 📊 **Complete Profile**: All student data in one unified view
4. 🎯 **Async Aggregation**: Non-blocking, high-performance
5. 🔄 **Real-world Simulation**: Variable response times like real systems

**This demonstrates production-ready enterprise integration!** 🚀

## 📸 Take Screenshots!

Capture these moments for your documentation:
1. ✅ Registration form filled out
2. ✅ Routing messages displayed
3. ✅ Loading spinner active
4. ✅ Complete aggregated profile
5. ✅ Backend logs showing aggregation
6. ✅ Different aggregation times for different students
