# ✅ BACKEND FIXED - Ready to Start!

## 🎯 The Problem

The backend kept shutting down immediately after starting because the terminal environment wasn't keeping the process alive properly.

---

## 🚀 SOLUTION: Use the Batch File

I've created a **start-backend.bat** file that will work properly!

### To Start the Backend:

```
start-backend.bat
```

Just double-click `start-backend.bat` in File Explorer, OR run it from the command line.

---

## ⏱️ Wait for Backend to Start

After running the batch file, wait for this message (about 10-15 seconds):

```
Started RegistrationApplication in X.XXX seconds
Tomcat started on port(s): 8080 (http)
```

When you see that, the backend is READY! ✅

---

## ✅ IMPORTANT: Keep the Window Open!

After the backend starts:
- ✅ The command window will stay open
- ✅ You'll see Spring Boot logs
- ✅ **DO NOT CLOSE THIS WINDOW!**
- ✅ Backend will keep running as long as the window is open

To stop the backend: Press **Ctrl+C** in that window

---

## 🧪 Now Try Your Registration Again!

### Step 1: Start Backend
```
start-backend.bat
```

### Step 2: Wait for "Started RegistrationApplication..." message

### Step 3: Go to Frontend
http://localhost:3000

### Step 4: Submit a Registration!
- Fill out the form
- Click "Submit Registration"
- You should now see SUCCESS instead of "Network Error"! 🎉

---

## 🔍 Verify Backend is Running

Open a NEW command prompt and run:
```powershell
netstat -ano | findstr "8080"
```

You should see output showing port 8080 is LISTENING.

---

## 📊 System Status When Everything is Running

You'll have **3 windows open**:

1. **Backend Window** (start-backend.bat) - Spring Boot logs
2. **Frontend Window** (npm start) - React dev server logs  
3. **Docker** (running in background) - PostgreSQL + RabbitMQ
